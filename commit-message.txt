Fix Replicate API connection closed error 32400

Replaced synchronous replicate.run() calls with asynchronous polling pattern
to handle long-running image generation tasks properly.

Changes:
- Implemented runPredictionWithPolling() function for async predictions
- Added exponential backoff polling with 3-second intervals
- Replaced timeout-prone synchronous calls in both generate tools
- Enhanced retry logic for prediction creation and status polling
- Set 10-minute maximum wait time for complex generations

This eliminates connection timeouts and provides much more reliable
API interaction for Imagen 4 Ultra model.
